            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I love coding, problem solving, and all aspects of computer science. 
                I'm curious about the different niches of software engineering, and am currently 
                interested in web development. I enjoy experimenting and playing around with new technologies. 
                My goal is to learn as much as possible, and expand my knowledge in the field. Outside of programming,
                I enjoy watching anime, basketball, and action-comedy movies. I also play tennis, and occasionally valorant.</p>
